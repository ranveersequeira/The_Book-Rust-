# Learning Rust Language from "The Book"

This repository serves as a record of my journey in learning the Rust programming language, following the official Rust documentation called "The Book." Rust is a modern and safe systems programming language known for its memory safety guarantees and strong concurrency support.

## The Book

"The Book," or [**"The Rust Programming Language"**](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/) is an in-depth guide and tutorial provided by the Rust team. It covers the language syntax, concepts, and practical usage through various examples and exercises. It is an excellent resource for beginners and experienced developers alike.


Feel free to explore the code.

## Progress

I will update this section to reflect my progress as I work my way through "The Book." Here is an overview of my current status:

- [*] Introduction
- [*] Getting Started
- [*] Guessing Game
- [*] Common Programming Concepts
- [*] Understanding Ownership
- [ ] Structs
- [ ] Enums and Pattern Matching
- [ ] Packages, Crates, and Modules
- [ ] Common Collections
- [ ] Error Handling
- [ ] Generic Types, Traits, and Lifetimes
- [ ] Writing Automated Tests
- [ ] An I/O Project: Building a Command Line Program
- [ ] Building a Multithreaded Web Server

## Contributions

While this repository primarily serves as my personal learning space, I welcome any suggestions, improvements, or corrections you might have. If you come across any issues or have recommendations, please feel free to open an issue or submit a pull request.

Happy learning, and I hope you find this repository useful in your own Rust programming journey!
